        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The best way to serve a PB&J is in donut form. With the help of Uncrustables, you can<br>
        whip up PB&J &lpar;or just peanut butter, or chocolate-hazelnut, you get the idea&rpar; donuts<br>
        in just 15 minutes. Cinnamon sugar gives the outside a nice, churro-like crunch, which<br>
        perfectly complements the creamy center.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 uncrustables sandwich</li>
            <li>6 cups canola or peanut oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oil to 400 degrees &lpar;200 degrees C&rpar; in a large saucepan over medium-high heat</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, use a 1-inch cutter to cut a hole in the center of each uncrustable. Press edges<br>
            around the center of the hole to seal sandwich closed in the middle.
            </li><br>
            <li>Fry each sandwich in hot oil until browned, 8-10 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels.</li><br>
            <li>Stir together sugar and cinnamon on a plate; dredge donuts lightly in cinnamon sugar</li>
