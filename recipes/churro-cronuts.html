        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These easy churro donuts are deep fried crescent roll donuts with a cinnamon sugar

            <br>satisfy a craving without going to the bakery.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 &lpar;8 ounce&rpar; cans refrigerated crescent dough sheets</li>
            <li>4 cups oil, or as needed, for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>chocolate sauce or chocolate hazel spread for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Remove dough from each can and unroll to a rectangular shape. Fold the shorter<br>
                end of 1 sheet up 1/3 of the way. Fold the opposite edge 1/2 of the way to fold<br>
                over &lpar;and cover&rpar; the first fold. The dough should have 3 layers. Use a 3-inch<br>
                cutter to cut 3 circles from the dough. Form the scraps into another layered<br>
                piece and cut out one more circle.  Repeat with the remaining dough sheet. Use<br>
                a smaller cutter to cut the center out of each circle to form a donut shape and<br>
                reserve for donut holes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan halfway with oil and place over medium-high heat to reach<br>
            a temperature of 350 to 365 degrees F &lpar;175 to 183 degrees C&rpar;. Line a tray with <br>
            paper towels.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish; set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Working with 2 to 3 cronuts at a time, carefully lower each cronut into the hot<br>
            oil. Fry about 1 minute, rotating occasionally, until browned evenly. Drain briefly<br>
            on the prepared tray. While donuts are still hot, coat evenly in cinnamon sugar.<br>
            Repeat with the remaining cronuts and donut holes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve with chocolate sauce or hazelnut spreading for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
